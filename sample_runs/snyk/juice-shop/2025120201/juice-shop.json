Hashing methods are used to make stored passwords and other sensitive data unreadable to users. For example, when a password is defined for the first time, it is hashed and then stored. The next time that user attempts to log on, the password they enter is hashed following the same procedure and compared with the stored value. In this way, the original password never needs to be stored in the system.\n\nHashing is a one-way scheme, meaning a hashed password cannot be reverse engineered. However, if an outdated or custom programmed hashing scheme is used, it becomes simple for an attacker with powerful modern computing power to gain access to the hashes used. This opens up access to all stored password information, leading to breached security. Therefore, it is essential for developers to understand modern, secure password hashing techniques.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Use strong standard algorithms for hashing rather than simpler but outdated methods or DIY hashing schemes, which may have inherent weaknesses.\n* Use modular design for all code dealing with hashing so it can be swapped out as security standards change over time.\n* Use salting in combination with hashing (While this places more demands on resources, it is an essential step for tighter security.).\n* Implement zero-trust architecture to ensure that access to password data is granted only for legitimate business purposes.\n* Increase developer awareness of current standards in data security and cryptography.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","InsecureHash","Security"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperlog/commit/d93cc65e485d740face1dacffa66dbcf03bcc7c3?diff=split#diff-b29a862e995b5e16d1763a35604cec4f13f3ca08bb9318d8f7ccfa24b757f7e0L-1","lines": [{"line": "return crypto.createHash('sha1')\n","lineNumber": 3,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "return crypto.createHash('sha256')\n","lineNumber": 3,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/raphael-group/magi/commit/1e1ed6435a97858e38d0cab962d7e248710f60e1?diff=split#diff-a4bd8e7c606b00ad2f2d6eeb95ba96714ece5c8b1266c2b503f3531b12d46257L-1","lines": [{"line": "hasher = crypto.createHash('md5').update(url),\n","lineNumber": 7,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "hasher = crypto.createHash('RIPEMD-64').update(url),\n","lineNumber": 7,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/steilerDev/homebridge-openhab2-complete/commit/6e92ef40f991cc372b701390945e0e5bbeb71016?diff=split#diff-34bbd467b1ab0e3497ce244b09d2bfbc4ab192303dd90b13603baf6711b522dfL-1","lines": [{"line": "function generate(name) {\n","lineNumber": 4,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "    const sha1sum = crypto.createHash('sha1');\n","lineNumber": 5,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "    sha1sum.update(name);\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "function generate(name, type) {\n","lineNumber": 4,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    const hash = crypto.createHash('sha512');\n","lineNumber": 5,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    hash.update(name);\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    hash.update(type);\n","lineNumber": 7,"lineChange": "added"}]}],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 134,"cwe": ["CWE-916"]}},{"id": "javascript/JwtDecodeMethod","name": "JwtDecodeMethod","shortDescription": {"text": "Insecure JWT Verification Method"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "warning"},"help": {"markdown": "## Details\n\nSome JSON Web Token (JWT) parse/decode methods do not enforce validation or integrity checks of the JWT.

In general, URL redirection refers to the ability of a website or application to redirect users to another site. This is often a benign and useful feature. For example, if a resource has moved to a new location, URL redirection can transfer the user to that location rather than displaying an error message.\nHowever, this ability can be exploited through social engineering, tricking the user into believing they are accessing one site when, in reality, they are being redirected to a dangerous site, such as a phishing site.

This method is good but inherently incomplete.\n* Be aware of all sources of untrusted input being sent to the server that could be used to redirect the user, such as cookies, URL components, filenames, query results, request headers, and more.\n* In particular, be aware of potential API calls that could send input indirectly to redirect the user.\n* To protect end users, use a firewall to block known malicious sites, train users to recognize basic signs of a phishing attack, and ensure that all network endpoints are patched with the most current updates.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","OR","Security","SourceServer","SourceHttpParam","Taint"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/sdeleuze/spring-kotlin-deepdive/commit/458cddfb1f56ef093493fc0ed607abc213f5867e?diff=split#diff-e27814d8f6c733d49f59d9a9dd91cf0b08a9f5b8b6edc4182cd1ad694c9db1a1L-1","lines": [{"line": "window.location.href = \"/\" + post.slug;\n","lineNumber": 11,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "window.location.href = \"/article/\" + post.slug;\n","lineNumber": 11,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/commit/9914130fb4d5bc33b70d9e241c08421dc0acc5c0?diff=split#diff-399936e2c30848185858188ac61c22f716f640e68fa5c63f7c95462f603e38a8L-1","lines": [{"line": "'Sign out'  : function() {\n","lineNumber": 66,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "    $.ajax( { url : 'api/users/' + Galaxy.user.id + '/logout', method: 'POST', data: { all: true } } )\n","lineNumber": 67,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "     .done( function( response ) {\n","lineNumber": 68,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "        window.location.href = response.redirect_url || Galaxy.root;\n","lineNumber": 69,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "    });\n","lineNumber": 70,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "}\n","lineNumber": 71,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "'Sign out'  : function() { window.location.href = Galaxy.root + 'user/logout'; }\n","lineNumber": 66,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/Smile4ever/firefoxaddons/commit/8c9efe39a03580ee19cc1406eb94b7aa737d7ccf?diff=split#diff-e927c30acdbf7d625655ab8a754663c7631e6ca851af3d0aae73c57e5dd78121L-1","lines": [{"line": "window.location.href = window.location.href + \"/2\";\n","lineNumber": 140,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "this.replacelocation(window.location.href + \"/2\", \"techradar.com\");\n","lineNumber": 130,"lineChange": "added"}]}],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 152,"cwe": ["CWE-601"]}},{"id": "javascript/PT","name": "PT","shortDescription": {"text": "Path Traversal"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "error"},"help": {"markdown": "## Details\n\nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nBeing able to access and manipulate an arbitrary path leads to vulnerabilities when a program is being run with privileges that the user providing the path should not have. A website with a path traversal vulnerability would allow users access to sensitive files on the server hosting it. CLI programs may also be vulnerable to path traversal if they are being ran with elevated privileges (such as with the setuid or setgid flags in Unix systems).\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19

"## Details\n\nPrototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `_proto_`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values.  Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n\nThere are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n-   Unsafe `Object` recursive merge\n\n-   Property definition by path\n\n\n### Unsafe Object recursive merge\n\nThe logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:\n```\nmerge (target, source)\n\n  foreach property of source\n\n    if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n\n      merge(target[property], source[property])\n\n    else\n\n      target[property] = source[property]\n```\n<br>\n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `_proto_` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.\n\n### Property definition by path\n\nThere are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of \"path\", they can set this value to `_proto_.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.\n\n## Types of attacks\n\nThere are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:\n\n| Type |Origin  |Short description |\n|--|--|--|\n| **Denial of service (DoS)**|Client  |This is the most likely attack. <br>DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`). <br> The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service.  <br>**For example:** if an attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.toString` by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on `someobject.toString()` it would fail. |\n |**Remote Code Execution**|Client|Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.<br>**For example:** `eval(someobject.someattr)`. In this case, if the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code.|\n|**Property Injection**|Client|The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.<br>  **For example:** if a codebase checks privileges for `someuser.isAdmin`, then when the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.isAdmin` and sets it to equal `true`, they can then achieve admin privileges.|\n\n## Affected environments\n\nThe following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:\n\n-   Application server\n\n-   Web server\n\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n\n1.  Freeze the prototype - use `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`.\n\n2.  Require schema validation of JSON input.\n\n3.  Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.\n\n4.  Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, `Object.create(null)`), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.\n\n5.  As a best practice use `Map` instead of `Object`.\n\n### For more information on this vulnerability type:\n\n[Arteau, Oliver. \"JavaScript prototype pollution attack in NodeJS application.\" GitHub, 26 May 2018](https://github.com/HoLyVieR/prototype-pollution-nsec18/blob/master/paper/JavaScript_prototype_pollution_attack_in_NodeJS.pdf)","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","PrototypePollution","Security","SourceServer","SourceHttpBody","Taint"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/wachunga/omega/commit/0ea594b103c957680b02e5b3d3e6763cf49d2c3a?diff=split#diff-a4c65ede64197e1a112899a68bf994485b889c4b143198bac4af53425b38406fL-1","lines": [{"line": "issues[id].assignee = assignee; \n","lineNumber": 47,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "issues[id-1].assignee = assignee; \n","lineNumber": 47,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/VincentLoy/tweetParser.js/commit/31ccbf365abbb6398fb78705074c11458421cec6?diff=split#diff-343e9403c50c367c18f841170513c764a80c01c26a0d9c2746a5fd632febe770L-1","lines": [{"line": "        for (var i in datas) {\n","lineNumber": 18,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "        var i;\n","lineNumber": 18,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 19,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "        for (i = 0; i < datas.length; i += 1) {\n","lineNumber": 20,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "            if (datas[i].contributions > 1) {\n","lineNumber": 21,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "                datas[i].wording = \"contributions\";\n","lineNumber": 22,"lineChange": "none"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/form-data/form-data/commit/16077142f975183ba8e3155c499dd6ac5b24a4a0?diff=split#diff-a0216776b159a7c9f71dd2ea85c1406d1f8aab69404773954af176b6db7897bbL-1","lines": [{"line": "    if (!FIELDS.hasOwnProperty(name)) { continue; }\n","lineNumber": 65,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 66,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    field = FIELDS[name];\n","lineNumber": 67,"lineChange": "none"}]}],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 32,"cwe": ["CWE-1321"]}},{"id": "javascript/ServerLeak","name": "ServerLeak","shortDescription": {"text": "Information Exposure - Server Error Message"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "warning"},"help": {"markdown": "## Details\n\nSensitive data includes: personally identifiable information (PII) of employees, customers, users, or other third parties; financial information; code; intellectual property; or protected network information such as passwords.

The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser's Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they've been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n\nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.\n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user's browser.|\n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user's browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n## Best practices for prevention\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code:\n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches.\n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.\n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","XSS","Security","SourceResourceAccess","SourceFile","Taint"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/nategood/httpful/commit/56bece201beeae6d80ed23a1195f7ab685dfde0c?diff=split#diff-27153a4cc821a38fb1466ae1c19c9f48fdc8b5028f971c1f88fd3d36af3081d2L-1","lines": [{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "    res.writeHead(200);\n","lineNumber": 7,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "    res.writeHead(200, {\"Content-Type\":\"application/json\"});\n","lineNumber": 6,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    req.on('data', function(data){\n","lineNumber": 8,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "        echo += data;\n","lineNumber": 9,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    });\n","lineNumber": 10,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    req.on('end', function(){\n","lineNumber": 11,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\t\tres.write(\n","lineNumber": 12,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\t\t\tJSON.stringify({\n","lineNumber": 13,"lineChange": "none"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/mjackson/unpkg/commit/db53a296aafebe18b854a0da2d4e09fb39e2aca8?diff=split#diff-efedef52a9612fa34544d4ad8a68232d242c481eaa0de73b416064cf5c5c4cb6L-1","lines": [{"line": "    return res.status(403).send(`Invalid URL: ${req.url}`)\n","lineNumber": 21,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "    return res.status(403).type('text').send(`Invalid URL: ${req.url}`)\n","lineNumber": 21,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 22,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "  // Do not allow unrecognized query parameters because\n","lineNumber": 23,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "  // some people use them to bust the cache.\n","lineNumber": 24,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "  if (!queryIsValid(url.query))\n","lineNumber": 25,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "    return res.status(403).send(`Invalid query: ${JSON.stringify(url.query)}`)\n","lineNumber": 26,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "    return res.status(403).type('text').send(`Invalid query: ${JSON.stringify(url.query)}`)\n","lineNumber": 26,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/angular-cms/angular-cms/commit/49e3845bf11f21e5f63997ed4c522cfa923c89a7?diff=split#diff-2458b7a314e52c34fd950457c17939524367c06572e8c78acfce08e6a6293e68L-1","lines": [{"line": "res.send(result);\n","lineNumber": 20,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "res.status(httpStatus.OK).json(result);\n","lineNumber": 21,"lineChange": "added"}]}],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 339,"cwe": ["CWE-79"]}},{"id": "javascript/HardcodedNonCryptoSecret","name": "HardcodedNonCryptoSecret","shortDescription": {"text": "Hardcoded Non-Cryptographic Secret"},"defaultConfiguration": {"level": "error"},"help": {"markdown": "## Details\n\nWhen constants are hardcoded into applications, this information could easily be reverse-engineered and become known to attackers.
